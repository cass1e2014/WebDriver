This assignment is to automate some scenarios on www.walmart.com, scenarios includes:
* Login using existing account
* Perform a search on home page from a pool of key words given below
* Identify an item from the result set that you can add to cart
* Add the item to cart
* Validate that item added is present in the cart and is the only item in the cart (not implemented yet)

Test data includes:
* Account details: email address and password
* Search terms: tv, socks, dvd, toys, iphone
```

```
Name of the project: Example
Name of the file: Solution.java
```

```
I didn't finish implementing automation test for scenario #5 
If I have more time, I will install junit package on my eclipse and implementing by asserting the quantity of the items in the shopping cart.

I would also consider the timeout issue of the web loading.

Thanks
