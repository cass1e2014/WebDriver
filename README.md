# WebDriver
This assignment is to automate some scenarios on www.walmart.com, scenarios includes:
1. Login using existing account<\n>
2. Perform a search on home page from a pool of key words given below
3. Identify an item from the result set that you can add to cart
4. Add the item to cart
5. Validate that item added is present in the cart and is the only item in the cart (not implemented yet)

Test data includes:
1. Account details: email address and password
2. Search terms: tv, socks, dvd, toys, iphone

Name of the project: Example
Name of the file: Solution.java

I didn't finish implementing automation test for scenario #5 
If I have more time, I will install junit package on my eclipse and implementing by asserting the quantity of the items in the shopping cart

If I have more time, I would also consider the timeout issue of the web loading.

Thanks
Cassie
